00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,480
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:11,040
Twain to my wife this book is

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,599
affectionately dedicated preface most of

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,150
the adventures recorded in this book

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,150
really occurred one or two were

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,090
experiences my own the rest those of

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:24,330
boys who were schoolmates of mine Huck

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,910
Finn is drawn from life Tom Sawyer also

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,070
but not from an individual he is a

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,800
combination of the characteristics of

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,780
three boys whom I knew and therefore

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,690
belongs to the composite order of

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,059
architecture the odd superstitions

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,280
touched upon were all prevalent among

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,860
children and slaves in the West the

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,190
period of this story that is to say 30

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,440
or 40 years ago although my book is

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,020
intended mainly for the entertainment of

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,270
boys and girls I hope it will not be

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,969
shunned by men and women on that account

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,940
for a part of my plan has been to try to

22
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:02,730
pleasantly remind adults of what they

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,700
once were themselves and of how they

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,460
felt and thought and talked and what

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:15,920
queer enterprises they sometimes engaged

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:22,439
in the author Hartford 1876 chapter one

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:26,490
Tom no answer tom no answer what's gone

28
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:29,520
with that boy I wonder you Tom no answer

29
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,860
the old lady pulled her spectacles down

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,720
and looked over them about the room then

31
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,329
she put them up and looked out under

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,360
them she seldom or never looked through

33
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:42,119
them for so small a thing as a boy they

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,880
were her state pair the pride of her

35
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,070
heart and were built for style not

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,009
service she could have seen through a

37
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,110
pair of stove lids just as well she

38
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,930
looked perplexed for a moment and then

39
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,960
said not fiercely but still loud enough

40
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,210
for the furniture to hear well I lay if

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,460
I get hold of you I'll she did not

42
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,860
finish for by this time she was bending

43
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,110
down and punching under the bed with a

44
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,360
broom and so she needed breath to

45
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,480
punctuate the punches with she

46
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,200
resurrected nothing but the cat I never

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,690
see the beat of that

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,819
she went to the open door and stood in

49
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,250
it and looked out among the tomato vines

50
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:23,500
and jimpson weeds that constituted the

51
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,959
garden no Tom

52
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,700
so she lifted up her voice at an angle

53
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:34,150
calculated for distance and shouted you

54
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,950
Tom there was a slight noise behind her

55
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,530
and she turned just in time to seize a

56
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,860
small boy by the slack of his roundabout

57
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,810
and arrest his flight there I might have

58
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,860
thought of that closet what you've been

59
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,630
doing in there nothing nothing look at

60
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,780
your hands and look at your mouth

61
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:57,180
what is that truck I don't know what

62
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:59,799
well I know it's Jam that's what it is

63
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,140
40 times I've said if you didn't let

64
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:04,450
that Jam alone I'll skin you hand me

65
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:08,019
that switch the switch hovered in the

66
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:10,599
air the peril was desperate my look

67
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:12,310
behind you want the old lady whirled

68
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:14,319
round and snatched her skirts out of

69
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,420
danger the lad fled on the instant

70
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,850
scrambled up the high board fence and

71
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,010
disappeared over it his aunt polly's

72
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:24,489
stood surprised a moment and then broke

73
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,720
into a gentle laugh hang that boy can't

74
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:27,820
I never learn anything

75
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,829
ain't he played me tricks enough like

76
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,560
that for me to be looking out for him by

77
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:35,019
this time but old fools is the biggest

78
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,450
fools there is can't learn an old dog

79
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:39,489
new tricks as the saying is but my

80
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,829
goodness he never plays them alike two

81
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:42,220
days and how is a body to know what's

82
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:44,650
coming

83
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,079
he appears to know just how long he can

84
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,299
torment me before I get my dander up and

85
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:51,430
he knows if he can make out to put me

86
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:53,380
off for a minute or make me laugh it's

87
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,870
all down again and I can't hit him a

88
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,280
lick I ain't doing my duty by that boy

89
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,920
and that's the Lord's truth goodness

90
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,709
knows spare the rod and spoil the child

91
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,739
as the Good Book says I'm a laying up

92
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:08,109
sin and suffering a for us both I know

93
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:11,620
he's full of the old scratch but Laza me

94
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:13,180
he's my own dead sister's boy poor thing

95
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,970
and I ain't got the heart to lash him

96
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,370
somehow every time I let him off my

97
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,639
conscience does hurt me so and every

98
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,710
time I hit him my old heart most breaks

99
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,700
well well a man that is born of a woman

100
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,710
is a few days and full of trouble as the

101
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,890
scripture says and I reckon it's soul

102
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:34,560
he'll play hooky this evening that's

103
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,900
southwestern for afternoon' and I'll

104
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,540
just be obliged to make him work

105
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,550
tomorrow to punish him it's mighty hard

106
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,560
to make him work Saturdays when all the

107
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,720
boys is having holiday but he hates work

108
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,120
more than he hates anything else and I

109
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,720
have got to do some of my duty by him or

110
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,300
I'll be the ruination of the child Tom

111
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,480
did play hooky and he had a very good

112
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,660
time he got back home barely in season

113
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,910
to help Jim a small colored boy saw next

114
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,040
days would and split the kindling before

115
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,410
supper at least he was there in time to

116
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,930
tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did

117
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,900
three-fourths of the work Tom's younger

118
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,460
brother or rather half brother Sid was

119
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,070
already through with his part of the

120
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,380
work picking up chips for he was a quiet

121
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:22,080
boy and had no adventurous troublesome

122
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,270
ways while tom was eating his supper and

123
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,760
stealing sugar his opportunity offered

124
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,250
Aunt Polly asked him questions that were

125
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,930
full of guile and very deep for she

126
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,600
wanted to trap him into damaging

127
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,660
revealment like many others simple

128
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,670
hearted Souls it was her pet vanity to

129
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,860
believe she was endowed with a talent

130
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,050
for dark and mysterious diplomacy and

131
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,750
she loved to contemplate her most

132
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:49,620
transparent devices as marvels of low

133
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:53,370
cunning said she Tom it was middling

134
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:56,910
warm in school wasn't it yes'm powerful

135
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:59,850
warm wasn't it yes'm didn't you want to

136
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,410
go in a swimming Tom a bit of a scare

137
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,900
shot through Tom a touch of

138
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,790
uncomfortable suspicion he searched at

139
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:10,200
Polly's face but it told him nothing

140
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:12,270
so he said known well not very much the

141
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,850
old lady reached out her hand and felt

142
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,400
Tom's shirt and said but you ain't too

143
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,110
warm now though and it flattered her to

144
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,970
reflect that she had discovered that the

145
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,640
shirt was dry without anybody knowing

146
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,220
that that was what she had in her mind

147
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,530
but in spite of her Tom knew where the

148
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,200
wind lay now so he for stalled what

149
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:34,220
might be the next move some of us pumped

150
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,750
on our heads Minds damp yatshi' and

151
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,250
Polly was vexed to think she had

152
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,280
overlooked that bit of circumstantial

153
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,650
evidence and miss

154
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,800
the trick then she had a new inspiration

155
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:46,660
Tom you didn't have to undo your shirt

156
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,840
collar where I sewed it to pump on your

157
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,910
head did you unbutton your jacket the

158
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,010
trouble vanished out of Tom's face

159
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:58,150
he opened his jacket his shirt collar

160
00:06:54,010 --> 00:07:00,250
was securely sewed bother well go along

161
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:02,410
with you I'd made sure you'd played

162
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,830
hooky and Benes women but I forgive you

163
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,680
Tom

164
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,750
I reckon you're a kind of singed cat as

165
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,930
the same is better than you look

166
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,300
this time she was how sorry her sagacity

167
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,430
had miscarried and half glad that Tom

168
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:19,330
had stumbled into obedient conduct for

169
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,890
once but Sydney said well now if I

170
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,280
didn't think you sewed his collar with

171
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:27,730
white thread but it's black why I did

172
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,500
sew it with white Tom but Tom did not

173
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:32,460
wait for the rest as he went out the

174
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,210
door he said city I'll lick you for that

175
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,000
in a safe place

176
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,440
Tom examined two large needles which

177
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,990
were thrust into the lapels of his

178
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,300
jacket and had thread bound about them

179
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,300
one needle carried white thread and the

180
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,310
other black he said she'd never noticed

181
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,740
if it hadn't been for CID confound it

182
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,870
sometimes she sews it with white and

183
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,000
sometimes she sews it with black I wish

184
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:57,550
to jiminy she'd stick to one or t'other

185
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,789
I can't keep the run of them but I bet I

186
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,560
learned to sit for that I'll learn him

187
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:05,110
he was not the model boy of the village

188
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,289
he knew the model boy very well though

189
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,940
and loathed him within two minutes or

190
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:12,490
even less he had forgotten all his

191
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,410
troubles now because his troubles were

192
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,539
one whit less heavy and bitter to him

193
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,820
than a man's are to a man but because a

194
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:20,979
new and powerful interest bore them down

195
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,620
and drove them out of his mind for the

196
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,180
time just as men's misfortunes are

197
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,700
forgotten in the excitement of new

198
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,979
enterprises this new interest was a

199
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,320
valued novelty in whistling which he had

200
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:35,200
just acquired from a Negro and he was

201
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,750
suffering to practice it undisturbed it

202
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,030
consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn a

203
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,830
sort of liquid warble produced by

204
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:44,200
touching the tongue to the roof of the

205
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,540
mouth at short intervals in the midst of

206
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,470
the music the reader probably remembers

207
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,130
how to do it if he has ever been a boy

208
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,020
diligence and a

209
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,150
tenshun soon gave him the knack of it

210
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,160
and he strode down the street with his

211
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:59,680
mouth full of harmony in his soul full

212
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,450
of gratitude he felt much as an

213
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,150
astronomer feels who has discovered a

214
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:06,640
new planet no doubt as far as strong

215
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,830
deep unalloyed pleasure is concerned the

216
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,740
advantage was with a boy not the

217
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:14,890
astronomer the summer evenings were long

218
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:17,230
it was not dark yet presently Tom

219
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,750
checked his whistle a stranger was

220
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,410
before him a boy a shade larger than

221
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,320
himself

222
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:25,240
a newcomer of any age or either sex was

223
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,040
an impressive curiosity in the poor

224
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,400
little shabby village of st. Petersburg

225
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,110
this boy was well dressed too

226
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:35,260
well-dressed on a weekday this was

227
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:37,600
simply astounding his cap was a dainty

228
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,510
thing his clothes buttoned blue cloth

229
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,720
roundabout was new and natty and so were

230
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:46,720
his pantaloons he had shoes on and it

231
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,060
was only Friday he even wore a necktie a

232
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,790
bright bit of ribbon he had acidified

233
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:54,310
air about him that ate into Tom's vitals

234
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,290
the more Tom stared at the splendid

235
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,870
marvel the higher he turned up his nose

236
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:01,450
at his finery and a shabbier and

237
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:05,020
shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to

238
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:07,630
grow neither boy spoke if one moved the

239
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:10,330
other moved but only sidewise in a

240
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:14,500
circle they kept face to face and eye to

241
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:18,160
eye all the time finally Tom said I can

242
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:21,340

243
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,490

245
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:30,640

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:33,850

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,730
then why do you keep saying you will for

270
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:34,839
why don't you do it it's because you're

271
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:38,079
afraid I ain't afraid you are I hate you

272
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:39,490
are another pause and more eying and

273
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,990
sideling around each other

274
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,560
presently they were shoulder to shoulder

275
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,129
tom said get away from me go away

276
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,949
yourself

277
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:50,110
I won't well I won't either so they

278
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:52,480
stood each with a foot placed at an

279
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,639
angle as a brace and both shoving with

280
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,069
might and main and glowering at each

281
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,350
other with hate but neither could get an

282
00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:01,360
advantage after struggling till both

283
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,420
were hot and flushed each relaxed his

284
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,449
strain was watchful caution and Tom said

285
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,459
you're a coward and a pup I'll tell my

286
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:11,259
big brother on you and he can thrash you

287
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:13,810
with his little finger and I'll make him

288
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:15,910
do it too what do I care for your big

289
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:18,130
brother I've got a brother that's bigger

290
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,509
than he is and what's more he can throw

291
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,660
him over that fence too

292
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:25,329
both brothers were imaginary that's a

293
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:28,149
lie you're saying so doesn't make it so

294
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:30,550
Tom drew a line in the dust with his big

295
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:32,470
toe and said I dare you to step over

296
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,019
that and I'll lick you till you can't

297
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:38,019
stand up anybody that'll take a dare was

298
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:40,509
a steel sheep the new boy stepped over

299
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:42,939
promptly and said now you said you'd do

300
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:45,759
it now let's see you do it don't you

301
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:47,829
crowd me now you better look out well

302
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:51,040
you said you'd do it why don't you do it

303
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:53,410
by jingo for two cents I will do it the

304
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,120
new boy took two broad coppers out of

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,059
his pocket and held them out with

306
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,029
derision Tom struck them to the ground

307
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:02,589
in an instant both boys were rolling and

308
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:04,959
tumbling in the dirt gripped together

309
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:06,790
like cats and for the space of a minute

310
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,980
they tugged and tore at each other's

311
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,959
hair and clothes punched and scratched

312
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,720
each other's noses and covered

313
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,790
themselves with dust and glory presently

314
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,950
the confusion took form and through the

315
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,080
fog of battle Tom appeared

316
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:23,020
destryed the new boy and pounding him

317
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,910
with his fists holler enough said he the

318
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,340
boy only struggled to free himself he

319
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:30,280
was crying mainly from rage holler

320
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,470
enough and the pounding went on at last

321
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,410
the stranger got out of smothered nuff

322
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,240
and Tom let him up and said now that'll

323
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,730
learn you better look out who you're

324
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,590
fooling with next time the new boy went

325
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,390
off brushing the dust from his clothes

326
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,070
sobbing snuffling and occasionally

327
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,780
looking back and shaking his head and

328
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,090
threatening what he would do to Tom the

329
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,250
next time he caught him out to which Tom

330
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:53,140
responded with jeers and started off in

331
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,210
a high feather and as soon as his back

332
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,550
was turned the new boys snatched up a

333
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,650
stone through it and hit him between the

334
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,020
shoulders and then turned tail and ran

335
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:04,060
like an antelope Tom chased the traitor

336
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,610
home and thus found out where he lived

337
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,590
he then held a position at the gate for

338
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:11,410
some time daring the enemy to come

339
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,630
outside but the enemy only made faces at

340
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,580
him through the window and declined at

341
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,920
last the enemy's mother appeared and

342
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:21,460
called Tom a bad vicious vulgar child

343
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,700
and ordered him away so he went away but

344
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,410
he said he allowed to lay for that boy

345
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,510
he got home pretty late that night and

346
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,300
when he climbed cautiously in at the

347
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,730
window he uncovered an ambuscade in the

348
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,220
person of his aunt and when she saw the

349
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,900
state his clothes were in her resolution

350
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,390
to turn his Saturday holiday into

351
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:43,120
captivity at hard labor became

352
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:46,830
adamantine in its firmness in its

353
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,830
firmness nan its fur
